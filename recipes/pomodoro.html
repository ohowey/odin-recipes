    <h2>Description</h2>
   
    <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a method to avoid distraction and be more productive.
        The basic idea is to break up work into 25 minute periods. After each
        period a 5 minute break is given. If you get distracted within the 25
        minute period you start the timer over. It's easier to devote 25 minutes
        to a task than doing something that may seem endless and the small breaks
        help you recharge. After 4 cycles a longer break is taken.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Timer</li>
        <li>Project</li>
        <li>Small tasks like folding laundry</li>
        <li>Motivation!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Find a project that requires a lot of hardwork to accomplish but is worth it</li>
        <li>Set a timer for 25 minutes and work continuously on the project.
            for that whole period. If you get distracted restart the timer.
        </li>
        <li>After 25 minutes of work take a few minutes break to do something 
            completely different. It could be folding laundry or having a small snack.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat step 3 for 4 times and then take a longer break</li>
        <li>Stay motivated and keep your mind fresh!</li>
    </ol>
