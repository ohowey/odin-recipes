        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When attempting something like the Odin Project it isn't a question of 
            if but of when you'll get stuck. Therefore it's important to be prepared
            with strategies to become unstuck. Being stuck can kill your motivation 
            so it's best to extricate yourself ASAP. And always remember, being stuck is 
            part of the process.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Google</li>
            <li>Taking a break</li>
            <li>Discord</li>
            <li>Review</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First try googling the answer. You aren't the first person to have had 
                this problem.
            </li>
            <li>Maybe your problem is an insufficient grasp of material that came 
                before. If this is the case then review past lessons.
            </li>   
            <li>If neither of those work then try taking a break. Our minds are constantly
                making new connections in what is called diffuse learning.
            </li>
            <li>If you've put in a solid effort and are still stuck then ask someone for help.
                This could be someone you know or through TOP discord.
