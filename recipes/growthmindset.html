        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Growth mindset is the understanding that sometimes difficult subjects
            take a long time to understand but that it is possible. This is opposed
            to a fixed mindset which believes that anything that doesn't come immediately
            will never come. If you have a growth mindset you will put in the effort 
            to understand something better. If you want to accomplish a project it doesn't 
            matter how long it takes as long as you do it. It's useful to go in knowing that
            it will be hard, not beating yourself up when it is hard, and celebrating your
            success despite the difficulty.
